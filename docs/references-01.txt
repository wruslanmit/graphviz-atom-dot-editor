ELEMENTS IN DOT GRAPHVIZ

(1) Clusters 
(2) Nodes
(3) Edges

A cluster is a group of nodes forming a sub-graph. 
Clusters are encoded as subgraphs whose names have the prefix 'cluster'. 

A graph consists of nodes and edges. 
The links between nodes are non-directional using lines.

A directed graph also consists of nodes and edges. 
The links between nodes are directional using arrows (arrowhead, arrowtail).

The basic arrows shown above contain:

    most of the primitive shapes (box, crow, diamond, dot, inv, none, normal, tee, vee)
    shapes that can be derived from the grammar (odot, invdot, invodot, obox, odiamond)
    shapes supported as special cases for backward-compatibility (ediamond, open, halfopen, empty, invempty).
