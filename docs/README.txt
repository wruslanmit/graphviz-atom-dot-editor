# graphviz-atom-dot-editor
Using the Atom editor to create and preview live Graphviz dot and gv type files.

Managed a working setup using Atom Editor installed with the following packages
(1) graphviz-preview 1.7.0 
(2) graphviz-preview-plus 1.5.13
(3) language-dot 1.7.0
(4) language-dot-template 0.2.0 

See the screenshots (in docs folder).

Write a dot file.  Then to activate preview 
(1) Menu -> Packages -> GraphViz preview + -> Select Layout Engine -> neato (both graph and digraph)
(2) Menu -> Packages -> GraphViz preview + -> Toggle Preview
Wait a few seconds ... a bit slow.

Once the preview pane opens, do not close tab (preview pane). 
As you edit the dot file, the preview diagram updates live. 
Done automatically, side by side. This is live rendering of your diagram.
As you type the dot codes, you get code assist too. 

Thank you to https://atom.io/packages/graphviz-preview-plus

Alhamdulillah 3 times WRY.
